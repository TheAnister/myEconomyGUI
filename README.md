# myEconomyGUI
The myEconomy Game... but with a GUI

# Sister Project
Checkout the [myEconomyGUI's sister project](https://github.com/TheAnister/myEconomy): a more complex economic simulator with a command-line interface

# Welcome to the myEconomyGUI project!
The myEconomyGUI project is a less-complex economic simulator designed for ease and accessibility. The user-friendly GUI is expertly crafted to ensure compatibility on most Windows devices. The modern graph-GUI creates a nice sleek look, and sliders are introduced to ensure that nearly all functions can work with just a mouse.

# myEconomy vs myEconomyGUI
myEconomy is a more complex economic simulator compared to myEconomyGUI, such as having boom/bust cycles, different economic sectors, etc. However, it uses a command-line interface. To ensure that myEconomy is more up-to-date, we have created myEconomyGUI - a less complex version of myEconomy with the base features and a modern GUI with buttons, text fields and sliders.
